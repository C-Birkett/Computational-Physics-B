- [.] Simulation & Data analysis

  - [.] Exercise 1
    - [X] finish 100k particles sim
    - [ ] get simulations using different seeds
    - [ ] data analysis
      - [ ] figure out how to properly measure fractal dimension from data
      - [ ] need to be able to estimate error in fractal dimension
        - [ ] find mean and std deviation or variation from multiple DLA simulations (100x, 1000x?)
      - [ ] think about numerical limitations of the simulation & its impact on fractal dim

  - [ ] Exercise 2
    - [ ] write checkstick funciton
      - [ ] random stick
        - [ ] different probabilities
      - [ ] average velocity? before contact?
      - [ ] think about what happens if the particle doesnt stick
        - [ ] maximum stick attempts?
        - [ ] maximum # of updates before trying new particle?
      - [ ] repeat analysis & compare with ex 1
        - [ ] does it effect fractal dimension?
        - [ ] my guess: no(?) as location of new particle sticking is still random as before

  - [ ] data analysis
    - [ ] consider alternate ways of presenting data
      - [ ] radial density of particles?
        - [ ] would this effect random stick due to weight in some given radius
        - [ ] more particles nearby => more likely to stick?
      - [ ] density at radius
        - [ ] what does the density look like at radius
        - [ ] largest strands will continue to grow larger?
    - [ ] compare with literature
      - [ ] result of fractal dimension -> should be 1.71 according to somewhere, so far mine is ~1.72 for large numbers
      - [ ] get sources
      - [ ] look at actual physical experiments
      - [ ] look at other DLA simulations
      - [ ] look at what metrics they consider
